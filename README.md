# My Thoughts on the Article

Skepticism about AI's ability to generate meaningful test cases has an added concern about data privacy and security. The fear about intellectual property leaks, data permanenc, and inability of models to "unlearn" sensitive data raises serious questions. This obviously creates many issues, namely increased potential for illegal activity using AI models.
